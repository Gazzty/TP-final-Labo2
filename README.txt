This is a program that allows the user to create and modify files in C, with data in an excel that exports to a file automatically.
Have in mind that everything is in Spanish, since it was for an university proyect.

To run, just execute "TP-Muinos-Gustavo.c" file like a normal C program, and follow the instructions.
